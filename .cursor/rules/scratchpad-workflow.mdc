# Scratchpad Workflow

This project uses a scratchpad-based workflow to track progress using a multi-agent approach.

## Scratchpad Location

- [.cursor/scratchpad.md](mdc:.cursor/scratchpad.md) - The central file for tracking project progress

## Workflow Roles

The project uses two main roles in development:

1. **Planner** - Responsible for high-level analysis, task breakdown, and defining success criteria
2. **Executor** - Handles implementation details, executing tasks from the scratchpad

## Scratchpad Sections

The scratchpad is organized into these key sections:

- **Background and Motivation** - Project context and goals
- **Key Challenges and Analysis** - Major challenges and analysis
- **High-Level Task Breakdown** - Step-by-step implementation plan
- **Project Structure Overview** – Key project points and High‑level directory tree
- **Project Status Board** - Task tracking checklist
- **Executor Comments or Assistance Requests** - Implementation notes
- **Lessons** - Reusable knowledge and error solutions

## Task Entry Convention

All new tasks must be appended only inside the Project Status Board section and follow this one‑line format. Do not create new headings or scatter tasks elsewhere.

```
**[<STATUS: DONE | WIP | BLOCKED | PENDING>] Short descriptive title – <link to the Linear issue>**
    - First actionable sub‑task
    - Second actionable sub‑task
    - N actiobable sub-task
    - _Success Criteria:_ clear, measurable outcome
```

Example

```
**[WIP] Create `updateChampionData` Script in `packages/cron-scripts` - https://linear.app/acme/ISSUE‑123**
    - Create `src/scripts/updateChampionData.ts`.
    - The script should fetch champion data (e.g., Riot API).
    - For each champion, verify if it exists in our DB (maybe with a `getChampion` endpoint or direct query if the logic is in the script).
    - Call `createChampion` if it doesn't exist, or `updateChampion` if it exists.
    - Handle responses and errors.
    - _Success Criteria:_ `pnpm --filter @side-kit/cron-scripts run start updateChampionData` executes the script, syncs data by calling the appropriate endpoint (create or update) for each champion, and reports the result.
```

## Development Process

1. New tasks are first analyzed by the Planner
2. Tasks are broken down into small steps with clear success criteria
3. The Executor implements one task at a time
4. Progress is reported in the scratchpad
5. The Planner reviews completed work before proceeding

## Rules

- The Planner does not modify any other section of the scratchpad unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- The Planner must not delete previous tasks; instead mark them with the current task status
