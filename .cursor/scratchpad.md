# Side Kit Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

<!-- Briefly describe the problem this project solves, target users, scope, non-goals, and measurable success criteria. Keep it 4–6 sentences. This should help any newcomer understand why this project exists and what “good” looks like. -->

## Key Challenges and Analysis

<!-- Capture the main risks, unknowns, constraints, and important trade-offs. Summarize investigations and link to docs/PRs as they appear. Update this section as you learn; keep it concise and factual. -->

## High-Level Task Breakdown

<!-- Outline the step-by-step implementation plan for the current goal. Favor the simplest viable approach. Split work into small tasks with clear, testable success criteria (TDD encouraged). Each task should be independently verifiable before moving to the next. -->

## Project Structure Overview

<!-- Provide a short overview of the monorepo and key packages (apps/, packages/, tooling/). Note that configurations should extend from /tooling (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind). Avoid duplicating configs; prefer workspace:* for internal dependencies. Mention common scripts (pnpm dev, pnpm build) if helpful. -->

## Project Status Board

<!-- Add tasks here using the one-line convention from scratchpad-workflow.mdc. Keep statuses in sync: PENDING, WIP, BLOCKED, DONE. Each task must include a short title, actionable sub-tasks, and a measurable success criterion. This is the single source of truth for ongoing work. -->

## Executor Comments or Assistance Requests

<!-- Log progress notes, decisions, blockers, and concrete requests for help. Keep entries dated and concise. Notify the Planner before large or risky changes. Move reusable fixes/insights to Lessons. -->

## Lessons

<!-- Record reusable fixes, gotchas, version constraints, and decisions with brief rationale. Include links to commits/PRs or external references. Keep entries short and searchable so the team avoids repeating mistakes. -->
